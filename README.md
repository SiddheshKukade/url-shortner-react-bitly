# ***url-shortner-react-bitly***
# Introduction
In this project , I'll will build a website that shortens URLs. Optimizing the length of your website's URLs is useful on space-sensitive forums, helps websites rank better in search results, and are also easier for users to type out.

# Requirements
The user will input a valid URL and click a "shorten" button. The shortened URL will then be displayed.

### Your UI should include the following elements:

## Text input for the user's URL
"Shorten" button to trigger the link shortening
Display area to return the shortened URL to the user
## For extra challenge:

***Made it easier for the user to copy the shortened URL by adding a "copy" button for one-click copying.***
Try to allow the user to automatically copy the shortened URL by using libraries like SimpleCopy or ClipboardJS.
Suggested Implementation
#### This project can be implemented as a webpage using any front end stack (e.g. JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue.js).

You can use free link shortenings services such as bit.ly to process the URL. but I have used React for front-end and bit.ly api for shortening the URL
